### Abstract
We develop a novel algorithm for large-scale holographic reconstruction of 3D particle fields. Our method is based on a multiple-scattering beam propagation method (BPM)
combined with sparse regularization that enables recovering dense 3D particles of high refractive index contrast from a single hologram. We show that the BPM-computed hologram generates intensity statistics closely matching with the experimental measurements and provides up to 9Ã— higher accuracy than the single-scattering model. To solve the inverse problem, we devise a computationally efficient algorithm, which reduces the computation time by two orders of magnitude as compared to the state-of-the-art multiple-scattering based technique. We demonstrate the superior reconstruction accuracy in both simulations and experiments under different scattering strengths. We show that the BPM reconstruction significantly outperforms the single-scattering method in particular for deep imaging depths and high particle densities.
